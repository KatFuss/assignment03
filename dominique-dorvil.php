		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>Hi! I am Dominique Dorvil. It’s a pleasure to meet you! I am born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I am a junior at the University of Rochester, double majoring in Computer Science and Digital Media Studies. Some of my interests include social media, video editing, digital art, graphic/web/app design and development. I love being able to express myself creatively. I do so by writing and painting. These are my first two loves before I convinced my mom to turn our house into a farm with three fur babies. But nonetheless, art has been a very important part of my life.</p>

		<h2>Discovery</h2>

		<p>)Since I went to an art high school, there was no computer science programs there. I learned about the discipline when I was looking at college and found the major, “Digital Media Studies” at the University of Rochester and saw that was a part of the program. I decided that if I was going to see if DMS was the right major for me, I should explore computer science. So, I applied to an organization named, Girls Who Code. I got accepted into their summer cohort in 2015. At Girls Who Code, I found my interest in web design. But I was also introduced to the basics of human computer interaction, robotics, and other topics so I took courses related to that at the university.</p>

		<h2>College Life</h2>

		<p>During my first year, I involved in a couple clubs. I never was apart of a dance crew until I came to college and joined the Xclusive Step team. That same year, I joined the executive board as publicity chair. The summer of freshman year, I attended a program with Twitter in San Francisco headquarters where I and five other students created a new tab feature for the social media platform. Then the summer of sophomore year (aka this past summer), I was in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is a lot like Rochester, to intern as a software engineer at General Electric Aviation. The only club that I am apart of on campus currently is the National Society of Black Engineers. I have been in this program since freshman year. Presently, I am on the executive board as the publicity chair. Through attending their yearly spring convention, I have gained opportunities and connections in the tech world. I am a writing tutor in training, a TA for a web design course, and in the process of starting a club.</p>

		<h2>Future Plans</h2>

		<p>As for the future, I am working on getting an internship design web apps and/or mobile applications so wish me luck! I already had several internships before this so I’m not all that worried. I hope to gain more knowledge in this internship like I did with my previous ones. In the summer of 2018, I interned at an art organization in New York City called Arts Connection for 9 weeks and was able to gain skills in content management for their social media page and curation skills. At General Electric internship, I was doing tests for their Digital Data Transfer Unit which is a device that talks to the pilot on their dashboard. I had to study the behaviors of the unit to create a software copy. I also learned how to fly a plane virtually using software that pilots use. So I can’t wait to learn something new with this next internship.</p>
