			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Hello! My name is Ana Acuña and I grew up in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, where mornings are sunny, and the afternoons are stormy. My parents work, and still work, at the local university, and I remember spending a significant amount of time of their campus in my childhood. My parents were really invested in my academic success which I think is rooted in them being successful in academia themselves. I didn’t mind the extra push as a kid because I liked school, being in the classroom, and learning about what teachers would lecture about. I was also pretty involved in school in things like Math Olympiad and Science Club, but my favorite memories are of when I was in orchestra playing the viola. The music program I was in really helped me develop my appreciation for music and motivated me to be better in all aspects of my life.</p>

			<h2>Discovery</h2>

			<p>As much as I love my hometown, I followed my brother’s footsteps and went to school far from home for college. While my brother chose to study in the Midwest, I chose the Northeast which is just as cold. Adjusting to college was hard because I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted to study, although I pretended I was going to be a hardcore business major. After some experimenting in Data Science and Epidemiology, I decided I indeed wanted to study Business, specifically Marketing. I really liked my Statistics courses, but I liked getting creative with a group of peers more than anything. Marketing just felt like the best fit right now! I’m also minoring in Computer Science because it sparked my interest in my journey to figuring out my interests, but not enough to major in it. Besides, I would rather dabble in different CS courses and have fun with it than overstress about it since it’s not where my passions lie.</p>

			<h2>College Life</h2>

			<p>When I’m not in the classroom or in the library, I’m either running around doing something for my sorority, Gamma Phi Beta. I’m currently the President and I was formerly the Financial Vice President so I guess you could say I’m invested in my sorority. I just want to do the best I can because I’ve gotten to know most of my friends through it! It’s also been a great avenue to do things in the community because I feel like it’s important to get out and get to know the real Rochester if I’m going to say I lived here for four years. That’s why I’ve also dabbled in community service programs here. Recently I joined a pen pal program hosted by the Student Association and joined the executive aid committee to help plan the program. I’m also a member of Student Programming Board and that’s really fun because we get to plan huge events like concerts for students of the U of R.</p>

			<h2>Future Plans</h2>

			<p>I’m not quite sure what the future holds, but I’m excited! This summer I worked at Allstate, where I met a lot of great people, but I wasn’t in the department that was right for me. Thankfully, I received and accepted an offer from Allstate for their rotational program. I’m really looking forward to that! I’m not sure where I’ll be placed, but I’m looking as that as part of the fun and as part of the experience. After the rotational program, I might go to law school, but I haven’t made up my mind about that. I might also want to be a User Experience Researcher. I clearly have a lot to figure out, but I have time!</p>
