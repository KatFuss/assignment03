# Assignment 3: Information Architecture
- Team Quito
- Information Architect: Jennifer Ngene
- Visual Designer: Clara Martinez Rubio
- Technical Coder: Kat Fuss

The topic being presented is about three University of Rochester students and their journeys of how they came to the university and their lives afterwards. It will be organized into four sections: **introduction** (to introduce the students), **discovery** (getting accepted into the university and discovering what they want to study), **campus life** (what are they doing on campus so far), and **future plans** (what they each are planning for their futures).

# Ontology
- Each person has a name
- Each person thinks about the future/has future plans
- Each person has a college life
- Each person has a way they identify themselves
- Each person are college students
- Each person had a journey of how they got to college
- Each person thinks about their backgrounds

## Taxonomy
- Introduction
- Discovery
- College Life
- Future Plans

### Choreography
The order of navigation is based on alphabetical order of their names: Ana, Andrew, and Dominique. I chose the order of taxonomy based on the chronological order of the events that happened in their lives leading up to college to what they are doing in college and to what future plans they will hold. Each person gets their own introduction in the beginning as a way for the viewer to learn more about each person.
